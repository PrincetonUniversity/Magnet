“It’s time to Upgrade the Steinmetz Equation!”- The 2023 MagNet Challenge aims to upgrade the Steinmetz equation with the support of a massive amount of measurement data covering different materials across a wide range of frequencies, waveform shapes, and temperatures. We seek novel and elegant models or data-driven algorithms to tackle this challenge and advance the understanding about magnetic core characteristics. The challenge has the following two tracks:

(1)	Model performance track: develop a systematic approach to learn from a large-scale existing database and apply this approach to new data and make accurate predictions.
(2)	Concept novelty track: any new concepts related to magnetic core loss modeling, including but not limited to fundamental mechanisms, hypothesis, and verifications.

The student teams will be judged based on the model performance and the novelty of the concepts. Student teams are also encouraged to write well-organized and explainable code for evaluation. By submitting the code, the intellectual property is disclosed to the public. Student teams presenting outstanding software engineering implementations will receive a bonus prize. 

## MagNet Challenge Organizing Committee

MagNet 2023 is hosted by the Power Electronics Research Lab as Princeton University.
