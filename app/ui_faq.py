MagNet AI is a pre-trained smart agent that can predict the behavior of power magnetics with neural networks. The dataset contains a large amount of voltage and current data (B and H) of different magnetic components with different shapes of waveforms and different properties measured in the real world. Researchers may use these data as pairs of excitations and responses to build up dynamic magnetic models or calculate the core loss in design. MagNet is continuously being maintained and updated with new data. With this webpage, you can visualize and download the collected data for different magnetic materials and excitations or calculate core losses for your specific design conditions using Neural Networks integrated into the webpage.

Since the voltage is measured across the secondary winding, winding losses are excluded from the measurements.")

To obtain the different shapes, the PWM gate signals are controlled by a DSP through the computer. With this inverter, the load can be connected to the positive power supply, the negative power supply, or to ground, so the amplitude, frequency, and shape of the output waveform can be controlled. For these types of waveforms, four duty cycles are defined, d1 to d4, corresponding to different parts of the switching cycle. Please note that d2=d4 in all the tests performed so far.

The data is collected by setting the water tank temperature at 25 C, 50 C, 70 C, and 90 C. The DC bias is iterated in 15 A/m steps from 0 A/m to saturation. The frequency and flux density are acquired in a logarithmic range at 10 or 20 points per decade depending on the material.

The percentage of the waveform above any voltage levels between min(V) and max(V) is calculated. Because d2=d4, and the waveform has only three levels, after filtering the noise, d1 directly corresponds to the fraction of the voltage waveform above (3(max(V)-min(V))/4) while d3 is the fraction of the voltage below (max(V)-min(V))/4.

As a result, all the errors in the measurement and processing of the data directly affect the output of the neural network. Only measured data is used for training, but the data is limited to certain ranges of operating conditions and waveform types. The quality of the output outside those ranges, or with waveform differing much from sinusoidal, triangular, or trapezoidal waveforms cannot be guaranteed. Other than that, the dimension of the neural network and training process has been designed to minimize the error in the H waveform and avoid overfitting. Finally, the network has been trained to minimize the rms error of the H waveform rather than losses, as a result, some discrepancy in the inferred core loss is also expected.")
